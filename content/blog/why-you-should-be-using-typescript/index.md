It's a little crazy to think that TypeScript has been around for the past seven years. Every day I see more and more companies adopting it in favor of JavaScript. I've only been working with it for about two years so I wouldn't consider myself a TypeScript master just yet, but I'll briefly give my two cents on why I think every JavaScript developer should start picking this language up. But first, let me give you a little backstory so you know where I'm coming from.

I graduated UC Irvine majoring in Computer Game Science, and I really had no prior exposure to web development. My main languages were C, C++, Java, and Python and I mainly worked on compiled/executable programs. All the code I wrote was object oriented.

I had no idea what I was in for when I started working as a web developer and had to use JavaScript.

##Why TypeScript?
Well, there's a lot of reasons! I'm just going to put down some of the ones that I really like about the language. If you want to read more, you can check out [this article](https://medium.com/@jtomaszewski/why-typescript-is-the-best-way-to-write-front-end-in-2019-feb855f9b164).

###It's easy to understand
Coming from an object oriented background, working with strong types is a godsend. 

After coming back from a vacation or revisiting my old codebases, I can easily just read through my code and understand what's happening. I'm able to know what any function returns, or what I'm expecting from my variables without having to explicitly document it.

###TypeScript is JavaScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. That means that all your JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. 
For me, this was big. 

JavaScript development is pretty much a necessity in the world of web development and having that security of knowing my time isn't wasted learning TypeScript really pushes me to use it.

###It helps me catch my mistakes
Typos and small syntactical errors can be painful when trying to debug in JavaScript. Luckily, TypeScript handles a lot of that for you with compile-time type checking. 

It saves me an awful lot of time having to catch my small mistakes and ensures that my code will (most likely) be working at run-time.

##Conclusion
TL;DR, TypeScript has been awesome for me because it helps me understand mine and other people's TS code just from a glance. It's made me confident knowing that the time I've put in learning TypeScript can directly translate to skills in JavaScript, and it also helps me save time with compile-time type checking. 

Thanks for reading! ðŸš€
